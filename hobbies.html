    <p>During this most recent semester, I joined the Georgia Tech boxing club. The club is divided into two teams, competitive and training; the former consists of amateur fighters who compete in official United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association events while the latter, which I am a member of, is for beginners and fighters that do not necessarily want to commit to fight in USIBA events. Both groups practice at Buckhead Fight Club in Atlanta.</p>

    <p>Throughout high school I played lacrosse, baseball, but have never participated in a combat sport despite being interested in them. Likewise, one aspect of Tech that has always appealed to me is the ability for students to explore previously unknown interests through the many, diverse extracurriculars present at the university. These factors initially lead me to attend the open gym sessions hosted by the boxing club early on in the semester. </p>

    <p>Even at these early practices, the comradery present among team members was immediately evident, and was a major factor in me initially making social connections as an out-of-state student. Throughout my first semester, the ability to interact with my classmates outside of an academic environment has been deeply refreshing, and is something that I will look to continue to expand throughout the rest of my college career.</p>

    <p>Likewise, making a commitment to the Boxing Club has helped me ensure that I make time to exercise even during busy weeks at Tech. While I initially went to practice out of curiosity for the sport, as I attended more practices I have continued to gain an appreciation for consistency and determination. The endurance heavy sessions, trained me to continue to compete when I was tired. Early on I thought that my running endurance would mean that I was already conditioned for boxing, but practices demonstrated the inaccuracy of this statement in a new type of fatigue that I had never known. Learning to work in spite of this tiredness has carried over to my work ethic for school as well and has encouraged me to continue to explore my limits.</p>
