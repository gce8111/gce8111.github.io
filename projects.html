  <p class="heading">Directional Acoustic Range Transmitter (DART)</p>
    <p class="heading2">Introduction</p>
    <div id="lradnaval-image"><img src="images/projects/LRAD_naval.jpg" height=100% width=100% style="object-fit: cover;"></div>
    <p>A long range acoustic hailing device (LRAD) is a specialized loudspeaker device that produces high power sound, on the scale of 135dB, in order to communicate at long distances, upwards of 5000 meters. Likewise compared to conventional loudspeakers, LRAD’s have a much narrower beamwidth, typically between 30 and 60 degrees. This technology was initially developed for naval applications as a solution for piracy; both so that ships could communicate to unidentified vessels as well as act as a non-lethal weapon to discourage boardings.</p>

    <p>Most drivers in speakers have a magnet connected to a membrane that is surrounded by a solenoid. By varying the current through the solenoid, the magnet, and hence the membrane, will vibrate and create noise. In contrast, each LRAD array consists of many piezo-electric transducers. The piezoelectric effect is a property in materials such that when the material is deformed it will generate a voltage, but also when a voltage is applied across the material it will deform. By varying the voltage across a piezoelectric material, the material will also vibrate and create noise like a speaker.</p>
    <p>This alone is not enough to generate the directionality or large amplitude of the sound waves generated by the LRAD. Rather, this device uses many of these transducers in order to take advantage of constructive and destructive interference. The inner array of powered elements are all driven by the same wave, and hence are in-phase. However, the outer radius of transducers are powered by the inverse wave, and hence are perfectly out of phase with the inner array. The result is that the amplitude of the beam formed by the inner array is larger than an individual piezo-electric transducer, but the net soundwave outside of the beam has an amplitude of zero (ideally).</p>
    <p>The objective of DART then is to replicate the directionality and amplifying properties of an LRAD on a much smaller scale, using consumer-electronics. Likewise, this would be my first foray into analog and power circuitry, and would significantly contribute to my understanding of signal processing.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Design Process</p>
    <p>I was able to order a number of cheap piezoelectric transducers off of amazon. Using the HIVE, I worked with the PI’s in order to become familiar with the spectrum analyzers and signal generators that are available in the lab. After some initial testing, I was able to generate an audible sound with one of the transducers using a signal generator. I spent some time changing the waveform’s amplitude in frequency in order to understand the sound characteristics of the transducers. For the rest of my testing, I used a sine wave with a frequency of 13kHz.</p>
    <div id="dac-image"><img src="images/projects/20231127_152757.jpg" height=100% width=100% style="object-fit: cover;"></div>
    <p>From there I began developing the circuitry to drive the array of transducers in parallel. I wanted DART to be able to generate waveforms on its own as well as be able to encode much more complex sounds than just the ramp, triangle and sine wave presets in the signal generator. I decided that I would use an arduino to programmatically generate the waveforms for the array. However, the arduino cannot generate analog signals by itself, it mimics this by using pulse-width modulation but it is not true analog. The arduino needed to be connected to a digital to analog converter (DAC). Initially I tried using an 8-bit DAC IC that the Hive offered for free, but I was not able to get this circuit to work. Eventually, I was able to rent a much nicer 8-bit DAC made by Adafruit from the Senior Design Lab on the fourth floor of Van Leer. This DAC allows for 256 voltage levels between ground and the reference voltage, such that 255 and 0 represent the reference voltage respectively. It is an 8 bit dac since 256 is the largest number that can be represented using 8 bits. Using this new IC, I was able to use the Arduino to programmatically generate ramp, triangle and sine waveforms, which I verified using a spectrum analyzer. However, I was not able to get the frequency of the output wave high enough to be audible. As such, for the remainder of my testing I continued using the signal generator instead. </p>

    <p>The amplitude of the initial wave would be 5V from peak to peak, but I wanted to increase the amplitude so that the sound generated from the array would be louder. To do this, I began looking into operational amplifier circuits. An operational amplifier (op amp) is an analog circuit block that takes a differential voltage input and produces a single-ended voltage output. To boost the circuit from 5V to 15V I implemented a non inverting op amp, where the output is fed back into the inverting input and connected to a voltage divider that is connected to common ground. The gain of this circuit is 1 plus the ratio of the resistivities of the resistors. Since I used a 2kohm and 1kohm resistor, the gain was about 1 + 2 which was the desired scale. However, when I tried connecting the piezoelectric transducer to this output, I observed a distinct drop off in phase and amplitude of the signal on the spectrum analyzer. One of the PI’s explained that this was due to the capacitive load of the transducers, and I subsequently began researching amplitude compensation circuits. Ultimately I just used another op amp as a voltage buffer which negated the changes in wave characteristics. Finally, I also created an inverting op amp circuit which was identical to the non inverting one, except the input was fed into the inverting input, and the non-inverting input was connected to common ground now. Since I did not want any change in amplitude for this circuit, I used resistors that both had a resistivity of 1kohm. I noticed on the spectrum analyzer, however, that due to manufacturing error, there was actually a significant amount of gain. I was able to negate this effect by using resistors with much higher resistivity. Likewise, they also doubled as a voltage buffer, so I did not need to include an additional one.</p>

    <p>For the frame for the array of transducers, I just cut a simple square out of cardboard and cut holes for the positive and negative leads on each of the transducers. Additionally, I noticed that the leads were soldered on very poorly, and were of much smaller gauges than the holes on my breadboard. As such, I desoldered the wires from each of the elements and soldered on wires that I had cut from the spools at the Hive. Frequently, the solder would have difficulty beading on the surface of the piezoelectric material, so I often had to add additional flux to the substrate. After completing this, I put all of the transducers into the cardboard frame, and held them in place using masking tape. I then took the leads from the in phase and out of phase transducers and soldered them together in parallel.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Results</p>
    <p>When I tested the array using the signal generator, the directionality and amplitude change were immediately evident. I tried recording the effect with my phone but it did not translate as well.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Next Steps</p>
    <p>In the future I would like to add additional power circuitry so that the whole device may be powered by a wall outlet. Likewise, I will troubleshoot the arduino code, so I do not need to use an external signal generator.</p>
