    <p>My name is George Crawford-Eng, I am a first-year electrical engineering major with specialization in signal processing and circuit technologies. For the past four summers I have been a digital communications intern at the MITRE Corporation, working in a signal processing lab at the National Security Engineering Center in Bedford, Massachusetts. There, I supported projects in RF and networking, ranging from demonstrating the Modular and Open Systems Approach (MOSA) to evaluating tactical radio performance in various emulated environments.</p>

    <p>At Georgia Tech, I have continued to pursue my interests in signal processing by conducting research through the Aerospace System Design Lab. As an undergraduate research assistant for the Structural health monitoring group, I have been evaluating the performance of different sensor-types for implementation in a potential SHM architechture for JetZeroâ€™s new blended-wing body design. Through this research, I have developed a greater understanding of how sensor-types like fiber Bragg grating and  piezoelectric wafer active sensors utilize signal processing in order to detect damage.</p>


  <p class="heading">Goals</p>
    <p>Working in the ASDL has affirmed my interest in electrical engineering, as well as introduced me to many of the topic's unique applications in aerospace design. I will continue to puruse research in this area throughout my undergraduate career. Likewise the MITRE Corporations unique positioning at the intersection of technical prowess and national security has confirmed my desire to leverage my own capabilities in service of a cause greater than myself. Thus, I am currently applying for internships in signal processing, especially in defense, for the summer of 2025.</p>
