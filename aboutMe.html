    <p>My name is George Crawford-Eng, I am an electrical engineering major with specialization in signal processing and circuit technologies. For the past four summers, I have been a digital communications intern at the MITRE Corporation. As an intern, I worked in a signal processing lab at the National Security Engineering Center in Bedford, Massachusetts. There, I supported projects in RF and networking, ranging from demonstrating the modular and open systems approach to evaluating tactical radio performance.</p>

    <p>At Georgia Tech, I have continued to pursue my interests in signal processing by conducting research through the Aerospace System Design Lab. As an undergraduate research assistant for the Structural health monitoring group, I have been evaluating the performance of different sensors for implementation in SHM for JetZeroâ€™s new blended-wing body design. Through this research, I have developed a greater understanding of how sensor-types like fiber Bragg grating and  piezoelectric wafer active sensors utilize signal processing in order to detect damage.</p>

  <p class="heading">Goals</p>
    <p>Working in the ASDL has affirmed my interest in electrical engineering, as well as introduced me to its unique applications in aerospace design. I would like to continue to puruse this area as a career in the future while also fulfilling my original desire to contribute to national security, which originally led me to join a federal lab. As such I will enter industry imediately after graduation instead of attending graduate school. Thus, I am currently applying for internships in signal processing, especially in avionics. Likewise, next semester I will be taking ECE 2026: Introduction to digital design, and will continue to update my website as I continue to iterate on my current projects.</p>
